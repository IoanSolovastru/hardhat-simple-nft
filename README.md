# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

# Steps
1. Add hardhat to your project
2. Add hardhat deploy - https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-deploy
yarn add hardhat-deploy
yarn add --dev hardhat-deploy
create "deploy" folder => Every time you run "hh deploy" runs through everything from deploy folder (Like truffle migration)
